# i706-lotsofdata-search
A trivial PHP application that displays a search box and fetches results from the database.

The problem the application faces is that the database contains so much data it is not easy to filter and order the results quickly.

# SETUP
Copy or rename the conf_sample.php to conf.php and fill in the database configuration.
Once executed, the program creates the database structure automatically.
